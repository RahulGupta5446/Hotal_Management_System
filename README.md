In my project “Hotel Management System” I have tried to 
show how the data/information in hotels is managed. This is 
just an overview of management in hotels. It manages and 
maintains the records of customers, rooms, employees and 
drivers in the hotel. The project is aimed to maintain the dayto-day state of admission/vacation of Residents, List of 
employees, room details etc. Main objective of this project is 
to provide solution for hotel to manage most there work using 
computerized process. This software application will help 
admin to handle customer information, room allocation 
details, Payment details etc.
The rooms have different categories like single bed, double 
bed etc. so their charges and records will be maintained 
accordingly.
This software has been made in a user friendly interface, so 
that anyone can add, delete, update the entries and handle all 
the transactions easily. As a security I have provided Admin 
username and Password.

And for project goto master branch
